When you donate to [foundation.webhosting.coop/donate](http://foundation.webhosting.coop/donate) you give to organizations that do the charitable work you support.  Many nonprofit organizations give far too much money to Information Technology (building websites, hosting them, maintaining them, social presences, email lists, cloud storage, onsite storage, security, the list goes on and on) in turn taking away necessary funds to give to their actual mission.  

How you can help:

Make a tax-deductible donation on our website â€“ [foundation.webhosting.coop/donate](http://foundation.webhosting.coop/donate)


or mail checks to:

	Web Hosting Cooperative Foundation
