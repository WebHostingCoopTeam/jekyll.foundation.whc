_____________________
When you donate to [foundation.webhosting.coop/donate](http://foundation.webhosting.coop/donate) you give to organizations that do the charitable work you support.  Many nonprofit organizations give far too much money to Information Technology (building websites, hosting them, maintaining them, social presences, email lists, cloud storage, onsite storage, security, the list goes on and on) in turn taking away necessary funds to give to their actual mission.  

How you can help:

Make a tax-deductible donation right here on our website â€“ you'll find both a strip donation box and a paypal donate button

or mail checks to:

	Web Hosting Cooperative Foundation
	1105 W Oltorf St, Suite 110
	Austin, Texas 78704

feel free to use whichever method you prefer
