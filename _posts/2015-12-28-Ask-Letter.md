Looking for year end tax deductible giving options?  We have a choice that will allow you to support causes you care about.  

Our http://foundation.webhosting.coop/ would be grateful for your support.

Our mission:

To provide education and technological services to individuals and organizations to utilize various media outlets to have their voices heard. Additionally, we are seeking to build the infrastructure to develop, consult, support and host nonprofit organization's online presence to relieve them of this all too costly burden.

When you donate to [foundation.webhosting.coop/donate](http://foundation.webhosting.coop/donate) you give to organizations that do the charitable work you support.  Many nonprofit organizations give far too much money to Information Technology (building websites, hosting them, maintaining them, social presences, email lists, cloud storage, onsite storage, security, the list goes on and on) in turn taking away necessary funds to give to their actual mission.  

How you can help:

Make a tax-deductible donation on our website – [foundation.webhosting.coop/donate](http://foundation.webhosting.coop/donate)



or mail checks to:

	Web Hosting Cooperative Foundation
	1105 W Oltorf St, Suite 110

Do you have questions about nonprofit donations and tax benefits? We had many questions of our own during the inception of the foundation. With that said, we are genuinely grateful for the help of the [Cullinane Law Group](http://cullinanelaw.com). Their amazing legal team helped get the foundation off the ground in 2013. Two years later we find that we are constantly referencing and sharing their words of nonprofit wisdom. Mollie put together an awesome guide to cover [Year-End Giving – How Do Charitable Donations Affect My Taxes?](http://cullinanelaw.com/year-end-giving-how-do-charitable-donations-affect-my-taxes)  We want to help other non-profit organizations with these fund raising efforts.  A big part of this is being transparent and making sure that other organizations can corroborate your status.  We are quickly trying to cover all the bases lined out by Mollie Culinane in her excelllent post.

Here's where we stand so far:

Help us on our journey to navigate these waters, so that we may help others do the same!  Happy Holidays to everyone!
