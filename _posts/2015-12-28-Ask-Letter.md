Looking for year end tax deductible giving options?  We have a choice that will allow you to support causes you care about.  

Our http://foundation.webhosting.coop/ would be grateful for your support.

Our mission:

To provide education and technological services to individuals and organizations to utilize various media outlets to have their voices heard. Additionally, we are seeking to build the infrastructure to develop, consult, support and host nonprofit organization's online presence to relieve them of this all too costly burden.

When you donate to [foundation.webhosting.coop/donate](http://foundation.webhosting.coop/donate) you give to organizations that do the charitable work you support.  Many nonprofit organizations give far too much money to Information Technology (building websites, hosting them, maintaining them, social presences, email lists, cloud storage, onsite storage, security, the list goes on and on) in turn taking away necessary funds to give to their actual mission.  

How you can help:

Make a tax-deductible donation on our website – [foundation.webhosting.coop/donate](http://foundation.webhosting.coop/donate)


or mail checks to:

	Web Hosting Cooperative Foundation
	1105 W Oltorf St, Suite 110
	Austin, Texas 78704
